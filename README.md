# 🧠 Intelligent Spam Detection System using Advanced NLP Techniques

This project presents an intelligent spam detection system built using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system supports multiple word embedding models such as Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe, and BERT, and uses an SVM classifier for prediction.

## 🚀 Features

- Multiple embedding techniques: Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe, BERT  
- Text preprocessing pipeline  
- GUI built with PyQt5  
- Modular code structure  
- Ready for integration and further training  

## ⚠️ Note

The trained models used in this project were saved on a university machine that I currently don't have access to. However, the complete source code, preprocessing steps, and model training logic are fully available here for demonstration purposes.

## 📚 Technologies

- Python  
- PyQt5  
- Scikit-learn  
- Gensim  
- Transformers (HuggingFace)  
- NumPy / Pandas
